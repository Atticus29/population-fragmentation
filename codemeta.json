  "description": "DraggleSimulator is an open-source simulation webapp that allows students to create a metapopulation of fictitious, diploid, monogamous, and simultaneously-hermaphroditic animals with replacement-level fertility (2 offspring per couple) called draggles and track it across generations. Upon creation, this metapopulation satisfies all assumptions of Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium except infinite population size (thereby only allowing the sampling error that accounts for genetic drift). By experimenting in either a guided fashion as seen in this example instance (Population Simulator)[www.populationsimulator.com] or in a less-structured fashion, students can explore how allele frequencies can change in populations even in the absence of nonrandom mating, natural selection, mutation, or migration.
