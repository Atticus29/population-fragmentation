# Specs

- [ ] A link to the open source repository is displayed on the first page
- [x] Instructor enters last name and if that name already exists in the database, a new name with a random numerals appended until it's unique is given
- [x] Users can see a table of allele counts for each generation
- [x] User can choose starting total population size
- [x] User can choose number of subpopulations
- [x] User can choose the number of generations to track
- [x] User can choose allele frequencies of brown, green, and magenta alleles
  - [x] Default frequency is ~1/3, ~1/3, ~1/3
- [x] User can see the individuals in their population(s)
	- [x] Lizard drawings
		- [x] Stripe colors according to alleles
	- [x] Lizard names are displayed
	- [x] Lizard alleles are displayed for each individual
  - [ ] Each lizard has a unique name
- [x] When user submits form, they see a individuals with GENOTYPE frequencies roughly equal to those of a HWE population with the given allele frequencies
- [x] User is asked to calculate expected genotype frequencies
- [x] User is asked whether the calculated frequencies match the observed (they should)
- [x] Mated pairs are displayed
- [x] Gametes of each individual are displayed
- [x] User clicks on make baby button under each pair and can infer:
	- [x] Which gamete each parent give to offspring
	- [x] the offspring resulting from mating events (the name and genotype)
	- [x] User no longer sees make baby button after two (x) babies are made
- [x] When all babies are made, user is asked to calculate allele frequencies of new offspring generation
- [x] User sees offspring population replace their parents
- [x] User repeats process above until x generations are done
