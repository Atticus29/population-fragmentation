In the case of this simulation, the error arises because each couple only has two offspring, which is a small sampling of all potential offspring they could hypothetically have.", "Expected heterozygosity: a heterozygous genotype is one where there are two different alleles. Expected heterozygosity is a number (between 0 and 1) that measures the expected frequency of ALL POSSIBLE heterozygous genotypes given the allele frequencies if the population is not currently evolving. Expected heterozygosity is a very simple way to measure genetic diversity of a particular gene. The higher the expected heterozygosity for a particular gene in a particular population, the more allelic diversity there is."];
