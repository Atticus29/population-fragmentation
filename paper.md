# Summary

The concept of genetic drift in population genetics is a notoriously difficult concept to teach and to learn. DraggleSimulator is an open-source simulation web application that allows students to create a metapopulation of fictitious, diploid, monogamous, and simultaneously-hermaphroditic animals with replacement-level fertility (2 offspring per couple) called draggles and track it across generations. Upon creation, this metapopulation satisfies all assumptions of Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium except infinite population size (thereby only allowing the sampling error that accounts for genetic drift). By experimenting in either a guided fashion as seen in this example instance (Population Simulator)[www.populationsimulator.com] or in a less-structured fashion, students can explore how allele frequencies can change in populations even in the absence of nonrandom mating, natural selection, mutation, or migration. They can compare how allele frequencies change in populations of different sizes or in metapopulations of the same total size but with different numbers of isolated subpopulations. For instance, the simulation could be used to help students explore the effects of fragmenting populations on genetic diversity.
